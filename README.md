This repository contains R code to create figures, tables, and plots with using Natality data from the National Vital Statistic's System. The code corresponds to births from 2014-2017, but should work on any CSV file starting from the 1968 (file format is different for earlier years). Code in this repository is either .R (R script) or .rmd (R markdown). Please feel free to reach out with any questions about the code, data, or manuscript.
